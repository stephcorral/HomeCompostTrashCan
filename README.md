# Home Compost Trash Can
A composting trash can that can take home trash and turn it into compost.


# Motivation for Composting Trash Can
I live in a small apartment with my teenage daughter. And we split up the home chores so not all the cleaning falls on me. She cleans the floors, bathroom, and litter box. I clean the kitchen, do the laundry, and take out the trash. I have lived in a bigger family setting and had to take out the trash when it would get full. Oftentimes we did not have access to a recycle bin and would combine all trash together. Even knowing it would create more trash issues in the landfills, I would still just think out of sight out of mind. and drag the bins to the corner for the garbage man to collect. 


My current apartment complex had a small recycle bin next to the huge dumpsters for trash. I would easily fill up the recycle bin with a couple soda boxes. 


At my place of work they would let me know that it didn't matter if I threw recyclables in the dumpster because there were no recycle dumpsters within the business plaza.


Out of sight out of mind is common when we are too busy trying to survive in a low income environment. 


# Silver Lining
No matter how low our income was. My mother always had her garden. She would purchase fertilizer and try to have small fruit trees in the back of the trailer. I would encourage her to try composting. And when she did it lasted for as long as she had time to add to the composting pile in the back. It didn't last long and throwing food scraps directly into the dirt ended up with more insects than she desired. 


And composting bins that kept animals away varied from cheap but would need attention. Or automated but hundreds of dollars. 


# Idea for a Solution
If there was a way to make a trash can, take all your trash, crush it into worm food, and dispose of the trash without going outside in your robe to make sure the garbage man doesn't miss your home, would you do it?


Would you allow your trashcan to be a different type of garbage disposal system without having to take it out every week?


# Welcome the Home Composting Trash Can
This trashcan will accept the trash given at the top layer. 


Then it will transfer the garbage to the second layer to crush into worm food while covering it in a sticky substance that will make the trash more digestible for the worms.


The third layer will be for decomposing the trash.


The trash can will have ventilation and the ability to turn thermal energy into usable energy to keep the trash can from having to be constantly plugged in.


On the top of the lid it will have a small display to advise what is happening in the can as well as what it needs. Like if it needs more trash, or if the trash is currently getting decomposed.


With access online to the stats of the stages of the trashcan.


# Possible Additions
Because composting creates heat, ideally the heat would be converted to energy to use as a power source within the trash can. As well as externally for a phone charging system.
