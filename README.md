# Home Compost Trash Can
A composting trash can that can take home trash and turn it into compost.


## Motivation for Composting Trash Can
I live in a small apartment with my teenage daughter. And we split up the home chores so not all the cleaning falls on me. She cleans the floors, bathroom, and litter box. I clean the kitchen, do the laundry, and take out the trash. I have lived in a bigger family setting and had to take out the trash every 4th day. Oftentimes, we did not have access to a recycle bin and would combine all trash together. Even knowing it would create more trash issues in the landfills, I would still just think out of sight, out of mind. and drag the bins to the corner for the garbage man to collect. 

### Current Trash Issues:
* My current apartment complex had a small recycle bin next to the huge dumpsters for trash. I would easily fill up the recycle bin with a couple soda boxes. 
* At my place of work they would let me know that it didn't matter if I threw recyclables in the dumpster because there was no recycling dumpsters within the business plaza.
* Out of sight, out of mind is common when I am too busy trying to survive in a low income environment. 


# Silver Lining
No matter how low our income was. My mother always had her garden. She would purchase fertilizer and try to have small fruit trees in the backyard of her trailer. I would encourage her to try composting. And when she did it lasted for a couple years, but then it needed too much attention that she did not have to give. In turn she began throwing food scraps directly into the dirt ended up with more insects than she desired. To combat the animals and insects she thought about purchasing a composting bin. But they varied from cheap but would need attention, or automated but hundreds of dollars. 

# Idea for a Solution
If there was a way to make a trash can, take all your trash, crush it into worm food, and dispose of the trash without going outside in your robe to make sure the garbage man doesn't miss your home, would you do it?

Would you allow your trashcan to be a different type of garbage disposal system without having to take it out every week?

* With access online to the stats of the stages of the trashcan.


# Possible Additions
Because composting creates heat, ideally the heat would be converted to energy to use as a power source within the trash can. As well as externally for a phone charging system.
